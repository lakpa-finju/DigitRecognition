# DigitRecognition
On this project, I have applied my knowledge of Neural Network and Tensorflow. I have created a Neutral Network that takes handwritten digits pictures as input and try to identify correctly between 0-9. The model uses MNIST dataset. I have already trained the model and saved it in the current directoy. I have coded using `Colab` which allowed me to further understand cloud computing and freely utilize free GPU. I am broadening my knowledge in Machine learning and trying to apply what I learned. Let me know if you want to collaborate on this project or have some advice/idea for me. Thanks.
